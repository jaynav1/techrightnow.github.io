As someone who is interested in technology, I’ve noticed that in videos that demo an app or service, often times the first couple of comments are “is it free?” or “how about a free version?”.

It’s interesting to think that many of us would have no issue with spending 3–4$ on a coffee but refuse to spend that money on a one-off app purchase (which can sometimes bring heaps of value).

For example, let’s take the app/website [Notion](http://www.notion.so) (which I’ve talked about [here](https://medium.com/tech-right-now/notion-and-the-value-of-delight-26618b5f725c) by the way) is a productivity app that myself and many others have found extremely useful and something that vastly increases productive input and output as a whole. Yet, there are many people who are averse to paying the $4 a month that it costs for the Personal Pro plan (which is the plan I would personally recommend for most people). The $4 a month that Notion costs is much, much less than the [$92 a month](https://www.ngpf.org/blog/budgeting/question-of-the-day-how-much-do-millennials-spend-every-year-on-coffee/) that most American millenials spend on coffee. So, what is this dislike to spending for online goods and services?

For one, most people don’t realise that the purchase cost of an app might be free, but often times you are paying something else in return for using the app — whether it be through ad exposure, the app collecting analytics on you and selling it and many more. That’s not to say that a paid app won’t collect data as well, but very often paid apps don’t have ads and are less intrusive on that front.

I recently read an interesting [Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Psychology/Why-are-people-willing-to-pay-4-for-a-bag-of-chips-but-not-1-for-an-app/answer/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D-Balaji-Viswanathan) on why people tend to spend less on apps, with the summary essentially being that anchor prices were set since the beginnings of these app stores (ie 0.99c or free) and these anchor prices influence the way that we think an app should be reasonably priced. Do check the full answer out, it’s a short, interesting read on anchor prices. The point that I’m trying to make is this- we have preconceived notions of a value that an app can bring to our lives, and we mentally set a price limit on what we would be willing to shell out to increase that value.

Certainly there seems to be a generational aspect that comes into this question of why we are so hesitant to spend money online. Most of you reading probably grew up when the internet was in its early years, and back then the internet was a much more ‘dodgy’ place to buy from compared to now, with highly established marketplaces and sellers. This attitude might have carried over from our parents to us, which is why we are so reluctant to spend money on apps. A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311447943_Why_Consumers_Hesitate_to_Shop_Online_Perceived_Risk_and_Product_Involvement_on_Taobaocom) done by researchers Min Chung Han and Youjeong Kim showed that in China (1), “product risk and social/psychological risk were negatively associated with consumer’s trust and purchase intention \[in relation to Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao\]”. Granted, this study was conducted amongst Chinese students, and was specific for Taobao, but it’s clear that this is the sort of attitude held by us when it comes to apps — we’re worried that the apps aren’t going to be as promised, or that they won’t bring enough value to our lives.

I want to propose an idea to you- the reader- next time you’re hesitating over the purchase of an app, or an online service, think to yourself about the amount of value that this app could potentially bring to your life, and how in context with all other expenditure, a mere $5–10 is nothing for a service that could potentially help us with work or life. I know that for me certainly, spending money on apps is something that is hard to swallow, but after discovering Notion, and other paid apps which have greatly helped me, I am starting to realise that maybe I don’t have to Google “\[insert app name here\] crack version”.
