Ahh, OnePlus. The self proclaimed “flagship-killer”. The brand that undercut the competition so severely that it attracted a large amount of hype, got a massive amount of traction and here they are today, 15 phones later.

But over the years, the prices of OnePlus phones have been going up and up — as they say, “you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain”, and OnePlus phones which were once flagship killers, are now flagships in the full sense of the word, with their latest OnePlus 8 starting at $799USD and the 8 Pro starting at a whopping $999USD.

And that brings us to about two weeks ago, when the @OneplusLiteZThing Instagram page was started. They started dropping the occasional teaser, with various Polaroid photos of staff working, and design ‘leaks’. Then, they came out with an official name — Nord, and with it a new Instagram account (@OnePlus.Nord).

The OnePlus Nord Instagram Page

In addition to the Instagram page building the hype, they’ve also made a four part documentary series, ‘New Beginning’, to document the journey of creating this phone.

To quote their page “It’s been a while since we’ve done anything like this.”, and they’ve talked about how the OnePlus Nord is going to be a sub $500 phone.

We’ve got OnePlus back at it again, churning the hype up for their next phone drop. One can only wait and see what comes out of this ambitious project. Will the OnePlus Nord come out with OnePlus One levels of hype, or will it flop?

I personally think that if they can undercut the competition like they used to while including decent specs and performance for the phone, they can absolutely dominate the competition in the $500 price range. I look forward to seeing more updates from the team at [OnePlus](https://medium.com/u/467a949d63d4).
