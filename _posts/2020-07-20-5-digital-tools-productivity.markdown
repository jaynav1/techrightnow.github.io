Behind every productive person is a system — one that is able to carry thoughts and ideas, and one that is able to be a person’s ‘second brain’.

_Note: I am not saying that these apps will suddenly multiply your productivity, but they certainly can help you get more things done. For more on productivity, I’d recommend checking out_ [_Thomas Frank’s Skillshare clas_](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Productivity-Masterclass-Create-a-Custom-System-that-Works/442860604)_s (not sponsored by the way)._

### 1\. Todoist

Most productive people use a to-do list, whether it be in a notebook or on an app. Here is my personal favourite — Todoist.

It’s a great to-do list app with a plethora of features, with one of my favourite being the **Natural Language Processing.** What this does is basically recognise certain key words that you use when putting in a task, and it can adjust the parameters of the task to automatically fit your needs.

For example, if I wrote “Write Medium post at 7AM on the 2nd of July”, Todoist would highlight the ‘7AM on the 2nd of July’ part and automatically set the task to remind me at 7AM on the 2nd of July. The importance of this feature (in my opinion) is that it greatly decreases the friction between having a thought and entering it into one’s system.

Other features include being able to have a streak, being able to set a daily minimum task completion, and organisation is super easy in Todoist. You can have tasks within tasks, divide them into projects, and then divide those projects into sections. Overall I really like Todoist, and although I am aware other apps exist, Todoist hasn’t disappointed yet, and it’s great for anyone looking to have an organised to-do list on all devices.

Use Todoist [here](https://todoist.com/).

### 2\. Notion

A fantastic note-taking app that is super customisable and easy to use. It’s got a strong community over at r/Notion, and they have a lot of user built templated available for use.

It’s got cross-platform support, and the team over at Notion are making strides to introduce a Notion API (integration ftw). I personally find that Notion is helpful for tracking habits, as well as taking notes in general for school and other tasks. I will admit, whilst its mobile apps aren’t the best, the web and desktop versions generally run quite well.

I have tried using OneNote and other such note-taking platforms, but I find myself coming back to Notion due to the great interface (more on that [here](https://medium.com/tech-right-now/notion-and-the-value-of-delight-26618b5f725c)), as well as the great customisation in my notes.

So, if you’re looking for a great note-taking app (with a myriad of features) look no further than Notion.

### 3\. Google Calendar

If you haven’t already heard of it, well, here is what I think is the best free, cross-platform calendar app.

All you need to get started is a Google account, and thats it. You get access to a Calendar with a great UI, and great integration with the G Suite (especially if you use an Android device). It’s super simply to enter events in, and you have options to add people, schedule a meeting on Google Meet, location, a description of the event, and more.

All the options you get when scheduling an event into Google Calendar.

And of course, as most calendar apps have, you have the option of adding in external calendars, either through a link, email address, and you can share a calendar to other people via a link.

_Note: I am aware of other calendar aps such as Fantastical, which have NLP and other cool features, but I think that the cross platform functionality of Google Calendar is hard to beat._

All in all, for a free app, Google Calendar is a fantastic service which you can use to organise your life.

Use Google Calendar [here](http://calendar.google.com).

### 4\. Microsoft Office Lens

With the world getting closer and closer to a paperless world, I’m sure that there are many of us who have papers and documents lying around that we would like to digitize, or perhaps we need to scan something to send to a friend. Whatever the case may be, in my experience, Office Lens is a great app to help achieve this.

Save options in Microsoft Lens

It’s great for scanning documents, with many options to scan such as ‘document’, ‘whiteboard’, ‘business card’ and ‘photo’. It has resizing options (although it normally gets it first try) and captures nice and clear scans. It can also automatically upload scans to your OneDrive account, which, if you’re like me, is a godsend, as it means that I can scan something on my phone and get it on my laptop only a few minutes later. It can also upload it into OneNote, save it in your device’s gallery, put it into a Word Doc, and put it in a PowerPoint.

All in all, it’s a pretty great scanning app and in my opinion, a must have to organise various documents and digital files.

Use Office Lens [here](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/microsoft-office-lens-pdf-scan/id975925059) (for iOS) and [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens&hl=en_AU) (for Android).

### 5\. Otter Voice Notes

If you’ve ever been in a lecture, you know that sometimes, the lecturer just goes way too fast, and you can miss out on important notes. Well, with just your smartphone, transcription has never been easier!

Otter Voice Notes is a great app for voice to text transcription, and its packed with features such as live transcription, automatic distinction between speakers, and a whole heap of sharing features. It’s also got an inbuilt search where you can search based on the specific word you’re looking for.

Of course, it isn’t always perfect in the transcription, but that’s why the audio file’s there as well.

For more on Otter, and a demonstration, check out my video [here](https://youtu.be/zDzHwhvLntc?t=71) (the video is skipped to 71 seconds.) Feel free to subscribe while you’re at it:)
