During these times of crisis with the coronavirus, it is imperative for society to band together and help each other to get through this. One way you can help is with [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) .

A quick intro to Folding@Home- it was first introduced in 2018 as a “distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics”. The way that Folding@Home works is by using your unused computing power from your CPU and GPU in order to run protein simulations and solve problems collectively with thousands of computers around the world. More detailed information about how it works can be found [here](https://foldingathome.org/support/faq/project-details/).

**What you can do:**

If you have a spare computer lying around that you aren’t using, or even the computer that you are using, you can install Folding@Home and get started.

It works on all 3 major platforms- Windows, Mac and Linux, and there are detailed instructions on the Folding@Home website which is linked above.

“Work Units” which are parts of protein simulations are given to your computer through the client installed on your computer. Once your computer finishes running the simulation, it will send back the Work Unit and receive another one, etc.

As you can see above, there are setting that you can use in order to customise how much of your computing power can be used, and when. There is also a big red button that can stop the folding process if you need all the power of your computer for a task.

Go ahead, dig out that old laptop, install Folding@Home on it and do your bit to help in the fight against COVID-19 (or other projects that are being [worked on](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/))!
