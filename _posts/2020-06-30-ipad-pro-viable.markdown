> “Is there room for a third category of device in the middle? Something that’s between a laptop and a smartphone.” — Steve Jobs

In January 2010, Steve Jobs announced a device that would impact the computing and portable technology space forever- the iPad. Introduced as an offering in between the iPhone and the Macbook, and it was the first tablet that really took off, selling 300,000 units on its first day.

Fast forward to 2020, and Apple is still dominating in the tablet game. We’ve also seen Samsung and various other Android based OEM’s introduce their tablets, but none have been as popular in both the education and consumer sectors as the iPads.

Apple released the first generation of the iPad Pro in 2015, and since then on, coming up to the fourth generation of iPad Pros, they have been advertising them as laptop replacements.

So, the latest iPad Pro- it comes really, really close.

But when talking about a laptop replacement, it raises the question, what really is a laptop? What is so inherently different from an iPad that we would rather use a laptop? For everyone, the answer is drastically different. For a video editor, the reason might be because Premiere Pro/Final Cut Pro is only available on desktop platforms. For a graphic designer, that reason may be that Illustrator is on desktop platforms only.

But for the common user, one that types up documents, does some research, watches YouTube videos, maybe plays a couple of games and does some light sketching on Procreate? The iPad Pro is perfect for them.

Even then, there are more solutions coming for creative professionals to at least use the iPad Pro as a devices for light work. Software like LumaFusion means that higher grade video-editing is actually possible on something like the iPad Pro, especially with the power of the current A12Z Bionic Chip. Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, and all these other softwares that are coming to the iPad means that creative professional work is slowly becoming more of a possibility.

The iPad now has native mouse support, and with its new Magic Keyboard, its easier than ever to get used to the navigation around iPadOS.

So when it comes to looking at whether or not the iPad Pro is a viable purchase, things like build quality, performance, etc are things that I won’t look at here, simply because they have been covered in depth by other YouTubers and websites, and even then it is an incremental update — the build is virtually the same as last year (it’s a really great build quality), the performance is even more improved than before, and the screen is amazing.

The question really comes down to whether you can make a transition over from Windows/MacOS over to the iPad, and whether the returns you get from moving to a smaller device is worth the $1000 that the iPad costs (without Apple Pencil).

In conclusion: is the iPad Pro worth it? 100% yes. With a great build quality, amazing performance and time tested software support from Apple, you cannot go wrong with this device. Before getting it however, you should take a long, hard look at your workflow, and whether you would be better off staying with a PC/Mac.
