Apple has just recently announced the return of the iPhone SE, starting at USD$399, a model that was first introduced back in 2016, it only saw one generation until a few days ago, when Apple came out with the second — gen iPhone SE.

And only a few days before that, OnePlus unveiled its brand new OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, with the latter now costing USD$899 for the starting price.

OnePlus, which first started off as the “flagship killer” has now become a flagship, whilst Apple has put their latest CPU, their latest image processing algorithm (SmartHDR) and water resistance in a compact package.

The unexpected entry by Apple into this space of sub $700 smartphones is quite the disruptor, as for the past few years, Android manufacturers like Xiaomi, Oppo, Nokia, Motorola, and even Google with the Pixel 3a have been dominating this space. There was never an iOS option, so if you wanted a new phone in that price range, you would have had to go for one of the Android phones.

In a space where companies could cut certain specs and features in order to reach the price level, Apple coming through with a lot of flagship features for not a huge price severely undercuts the competition. Sure, it may not have the latest bezel-less design or pop-up camera, but at that pricepoint most people are not looking for the latest bleeding edge features, and rather, **_value for money and reliability._**

So now where does the Pixel 4a come in to the equation? Last year, Google made an impact in the budget smartphone space when they brought their flagship camera technology and processing down into a package that retailed for only $799, with frequent discounts and deals from Google. This year, rumours already show us that the “a” series is going to make a return, with leaked specs showing a Snapdragon 730, a 5.18 inch screen, a 12.2 MP rear camera and no water resistance.

Assuming that it comes at the same price point as last year, it’s going to be competing directly with the iPhone SE, and unfortunately it seems like the Pixel 4a is going to have to offer more than just its trademark Pixel camera, as the iPhone brings down their excellent camera and more. Will it have Motion Sense? We’ll just have to wait and see.

Another thing to consider is that iOS just has much better software support, so if you wanted to pick a phone based on its durability in the long run, the iPhone is the definite choice.

So for now, the iPhone SE has the upper hand, but things can very well change by the time of the release of the Pixel 4a.
